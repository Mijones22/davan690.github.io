As I make this website more accessible there will be comments and other simple feedback options but due to security issues I have left these dynamic content till a later date. Here are some basic communication options.

## *Contact me*

### if you have any ideas or would like to contribute in any way that works.

[Send a message](https:/facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/) on social media (sorry i dont have comments working on page yet).

**or**

`anthony.davidson@canberra.edu.au` any points that don't make sense.

**or even better**

[Fork](https://github.com/davan690/davan690.github.io) the repository and add any comments via git commits.
