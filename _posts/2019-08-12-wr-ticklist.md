| Task                                                         | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Include the Table of Contents short summary at the start of the Word document. |       |
| Type the title and all headings aligned left, with only the first letter of the first word and of any proper name capitalised. |       |
| Main headings (Introduction, Materials and methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, References) are set in bold roman (not italic) type. Minor headings are set in light italic type. |       |
| Do not indent paragraphs or use a carriage-return (Enter) at the end of lines within a paragraph. |       |
| Do not use initial capitals for vernacular names of species except where the name is based on a proper name (e.g. regent honeyeater, but Port Lincoln parrot; sugar glider, but Leadbeater´s possum). |       |
| Use ´s´ not ´z´ in words such as ´recognise´, ´analyse´ and ´organisation´. |       |
| Use the conventions ´from … to´, ´between … and´, ´range x-y´. |       |
| Use single quotation marks.                                  |       |
| Check that all references mentioned in the text are in the References, and *vice versa*. |       |
| List references in the text in chronological order, separated by semi-colons. List references in the References list in alphabetical order. In the text, do not use a comma between the author´s name and the date. |       |
| Give journal and book titles in full in the References list. |       |
| Do not use tabs to create hanging indents within the References. |       |
| Spell out numbers less than 10 unless with a unit. Type a space between a numeral and its unit. |       |
| Prepare figures with symbols and letters appropriate for the reduction intended. Use Helvetica or another sans-serif font in figures. |       |
| Check that stippling and/or symbols in figures are legible at the size likely to be used in the published paper. |       |
| Type tables using the table menu in Word with the title as a separate paragraph. Put explanatory matter referring to the table as a whole in a headnote, which should be in a separate paragraph from the title, and directly under the heading. |       |
| Indicate approximate positions of figures and tables on the manuscript. |       |
| Check that figures and tables are numbered in the order in which they are discussed in the text. |       |
| Provide a running head for the paper of not more than 50 characters (including spaces). |       |
