As I have been working in `. git` I have found a series of easy wins for my colla oration and research. `gists` are one of these. 

In short they are an easy way to share small bits of code over a weblink. 

## Resources

The general code structure for embedding `gists` are:

```<script src="https://gist.github.com/username/gist-id.js"></script>```

Here is a nice blog explaining how to use `gists` [here](https://www.labnol.org/internet/github-gist-tutorial/28499/) and the normal resources can be found on github.

## My notes

As far as I can tell `gists` can be used in many ways but one simple use is as a stepping stone to building packages that are simply collections of `gists` with similar uses.

1. We can look at `gists` using the html code

```<script src="https://gist.github.com/rossmounce/6714509.js"></script>```

2. `gists` are simplified github repos

3. You can't push to a `gist` but you can a `github` repo

4. 

### Examples

Here is my first ever `gist`:

```<script src="https://gist.github.com/davan690/f03ba3ce0e99b57ca59cd1afead8b8be#file-anova-r"</script>```

But u can't just copy the URL. You have to use the following code snip:
