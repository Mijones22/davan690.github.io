There are so many amazing blogs on the web for doing different variations of RMarkdown but less on bookdown and converting .md to online books/ebooks. Because this is in the same language as  `Rmd` and developers using the `gitflow` I apply to insure my research projects are reproducible. I believe that this is a considerable step in the right direction for science.

- [The whole bookdown guide for a start](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html/): its good but it just seems that an independent blog or `a stack-overflow` feed is easier to find the answers in. A good start to begin to build RMarkdown documents quickly.

## DOCx fun!

I hate to think currently but there are many options around this using a range of workflows.
