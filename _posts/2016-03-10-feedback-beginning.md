    <p>As I am building this website and the resources surrounding my statistics work I will have and continue to made mistakes and miss points. I look forward to the feedback.</p>

I am often not sure how best to manage feedback at the best of times. As I work in an open-source framework I will have to get better at it as my work is always easily accessible if you know where to look. This is the beginning of developing some guidelines for feedback both for me personally and for the website.

As a start, here are some personal notes from Hugh's talk at the University of Canberra today. Hugh is a founder of the [thinkwell series]("https://ithinkwell.com.au/"). Believe it or not I remember being introduced to these resources very early on and even carried [writing guide](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop/turbocharge-your-writing) from NZ before I started my PhD.

## Kol aspects

There are many free notes and resources for the [thinkwell](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au) approach online including [books]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop") and [resources]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/resources"). I particularly liked these concepts from todays workshop.

#### The PhD comic

- A nice light-hearted comic

#### The Pareto Principle

The 80/20 rule

| Current | Final draft | Submitted |
| ----- | ----------- | --------- |
|       |             |        |
|       |             |        |
|       |             |        |



**80% rule is when you can’t tell if it is getting any better**

## Feedback

It is best to think of feedback as free advice. Some of it might be good and some bad but you definitely don't listen to all the advice people try to give you. Good feedback is not judgemental.

### What to ask

- Clearly

- Ask better questions

- Timing

- Reminder after 5-10days or send a reminder

- Deadline

## Dealing with comments

1. Split comments ups to ‘must does’ and ‘ideas’...

If the comments are instructions then do them but ask again if you are not sure what the answer is. In other words make sure you know what to do before you start doing it.

## My notes

- Small bits of writing = blogs = 1 a day?
- Here `blogdown` can work alongside these resources

#### Interesting note

Tutorials on how to make this work are common and the [thinkwell](www.ithinkwell.com.au) resources are some of the best, however, dealing with these three elements together a constant challenge to mentally keep on top of and for me result in :

1. Missing deadlines because document is not good enough
2. Handing in incorrect/poor quality drafts
3. Imposter syndrome/actually im just not smart enough to even be an imposter.... lol
