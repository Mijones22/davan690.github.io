    <p>As I am building this website and the resources surrounding my statistics work I will have and continue to made mistakes and miss points. I look forward to the feedback.</p>

I am often not sure how best to manage feedback at the best of times. As I work in an open-source framework I will have to get better at it as my work is always easily accessible if you know where to look. This is the beginning of developing some guidelines for feedback both for me personally and for the website.

As a start, here are some personal notes from Hugh's talk at the University of Canberra today. Hugh is a founder of the [thinkwell series]("https://ithinkwell.com.au/"). 

## Kol aspects

There are many free notes and resources for the [thinkwell](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au) approach online including [books]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop") and [resources]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/resources"). I particularly liked these concepts from todays workshop:

- The PhD comic
  - A nice light-hearted comic









- The Pareto Principle

  - The 80/20 rule

  - 80% rule is when you canâ€™t tell if it is getting any better

    | Current | Final draft | Submitted |
    | ----- | ----------- | --------- |
    |       |             |        |
    |       |             |        |
    |       |             |        |

Integrating this with a structured time management when some 20% needs to be done for for each paper. Tutorials on how to make this work is easy however how do you deal with these three elements together:

1. Missing deadlines because document is not good enough
2. Handing in incorrect drafts
3. Imposter syndrome

## Feedback

It is best to think of feedback as free advice. Some of it might be good and some bad but you definitely don't listen to all the advice people try to give you. Good feedback is not judgemental.

### What to ask

- Clearly

- Ask better questions

- Timing

- Reminder after 5-10days or send a reminder

- Deadline

## Comments

Split comments ups to must does and ideas...

If the comments are instructions then do them but ask again if you are not sure what the answer is.

## My notes

- Small bits of writing = blogs = 1 a day?
- Here `blogdown` can work alongside these resources
- Amazing!
