Pre-submission has always been a concept in Science. The idea that we are all bias as researchers should hit home for all researchers and the tools to allow our research to be reproducible and un-bias should be at the forfront of our box of tools however this is not the case prior to recent developments in part to [this](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) Nature article on Scientific reproducibility.

Thankfully, a collection of open-minded scientists have created and mantained a `osf` database with the tools to allow multidisplinary collabouration and reproducibility in science.
