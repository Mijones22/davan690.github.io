As I am working in R Studio and `Github` I have found that I get stuck between word processing and analysis with references.

## My notes

Like so many open source resources there are at least three different ways to achieve this outcome. This is likely to change for the better in the future but for now I am using different `packages or gems` for analysis documents and website docs until I find a better option. 

- [jekyll-scholar gem](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar)

  The thing is I don't really even understand how `gems` work so I have been doing some investigation.
