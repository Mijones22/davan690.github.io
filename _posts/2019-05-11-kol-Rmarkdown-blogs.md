There are so many amazing blogs on the web for doing different variations of RMarkdown and its subsequent outcomes. Here is a collection of currently interesting markdown/RMarkdown blogs:

{: style="text-align: justify"}

- [The RStudio guide for a start](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html/): its good but it just seems that an independent blog or `a stack-overflow` feed is easier to find the answers in. A good start to begin to build RMarkdown documents quickly.

- [Projects as webpages](https://github.blog/2016-08-22-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages/): Directly from the GIThub blog pages.

- [RMarkdown](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reproducible-projects-with-rstudio-and-r-markdown.html): Introduction to Data Science.
Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R
Rafael A. Irizarry (2019-04-22)

- [Reproducible research course](https://repr-res-r.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/rmarkdown.html): A more interesting RMarkdown online guide

## Unique tools for RMarkdown

[Working with tables](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/Recommendations-rmarkdown.html): summary tables are hard at the best of times but this package is amazing if you can get the tables to render in the output format (word tables are fussy)
