Prose.io is called "a content editor for GitHub". One thing is does really well is it gives people the ability to update their own websites, especially those who don't have the time and energy to learn how to write code. While there is plenty of great technical documentation for Prose on GitHub, there is very little documentation for people who don't code. Prose is very similar to the visual editor included in WordPress that many people use for writing blog posts. But not everybody has a WordPress website and I encourage most of my clients to steer clear of it (4 Reasons to Leave Wordpress).
