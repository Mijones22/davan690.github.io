As I build my resources through this platform I will continue to add external resources. Here are a few I can think of currently.

## Internal links

Internal links turn out to be quite important. Now this really shows how ignorant I am to the computing world other than [ecological statistics]("https://www.ssnhub.com/ecological-statistics/") but there are a few really important bits of the internet to understand when dealing with links within a website.

### Permalinkâ€™s



## External links

### Cronical links

[A blog that will hopefully help soon]("https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/handling-articles-on-external-sites/")

### SEO



### Liquid

- The base of tags and categories [here]("https://shopify.github.io/liquid/")

### Shopify

[Here]("https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app/") and this is about all I know currently.

## Direct links
