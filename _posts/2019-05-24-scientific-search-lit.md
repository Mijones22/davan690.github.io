Over the past ten years I have been conducting research for my undergraduate degree, Master's and now PhD. Through this time period (2007-2019) the way we search and find valid scientific literature is pretty much the same. There are journal articles and then everything else....

<-picture of something here>

However, I think that the places we are searching (**cite**) and how we do that (**cite**) has changed dramatically. This is not a small change for the way university conduct research or teach and old processes need to account for this.

Over the course of these blogs I will be finalising the literature I have for my PhD and extend on this "search method" with up-to date tools and workflows. Any PhD focuses on the questions being addressed and the ability to produce sound scientific research. However, f we do not have the skills needed to accurately assess the "literature landscape" we become prone to problems such as "researcher bias" and other problems that may not be possible to detect in the results or publication information.

- reproducibility out of place here....

To do this we need the ability to create a database of resources which contain all the relevant information for the production of the research documentation we present but also so that we have the ability to assess the possible "research bias" within and between publications. Throughout my PhD I have strived to ensure that my work actively reduces bias at all stages of the scientific process. To help me to think about the different types of bias possible not just in a particular process or step but during the entirety of the scientific project. This is a key step in understanding how reproducibility can be increased and viable scientific conclusions can be reached with confidence.
