There are many many different posts on reproducible workflows. This document collects the current resources available in 'R' and 'RMarkdown'. I have started this document from the [BES guidelines](https://github.com/BES2016Workshop/guidebook) published in 2017. There is a collection of the BES guides [here](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/guides-to/). However because my workflow has a distinctly ecological feel along with the 'tidyverse' approach of [tooling](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). My apologies for this in advance. If you are not a R user I would recommend modifying this workflow or finding another workflow with the same components but in your field.

## Overview

Since the development of R and RStudio (and a magnitude of other IT changes happening at the same time) there are now tools for working with issues to do with [reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970). There are many blogs from a simple web search. 
Here is a collection of the posts I have drawn inspiration from:

- [R bloggers post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reproducible-research-and-r-workflow/): Jeromy Anglim
- [Reproducible workflows in RStudio](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/basic-git-lesson/2016/08/25/)

## General databases

- [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/about/) is a non-profit initiative founded in 2011 by Karthik Ram, Scott Chamberlain, and Carl Boettiger to make scientific data retrieval reproducible. Over the past seven years we have developed an ecosystem of open source tools, we run annual conferences, and review community developed software.
- [The Reproducible Research CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html): They have produced a great interface for reproducible packages in R with documentation.

With all the resources above I have created a evolving "workflow" for my research found [here](https://github.com/davan690/reproducible-guide/). I am building this into a webpage/book but it is still under development [here]("https://davan690.github.io/reproducible-guide).
