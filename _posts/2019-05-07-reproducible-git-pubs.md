title: GIT and GITHUB
subtitle: A scientific paper for GIT workflow application for bio-informatics
layout: post

I have been reading a paper today [about](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947).... you won't believe it. [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) and [GIThub](https://github.com/) for bio-informatics in [PLOSone](https://journals.plos.org/).

<-- insert paper image-->

The paper is focused on using `GIT` and `GIThub` for bio-informatics but do say that the workflow can be for any scientific research project.

## Take home points

Although this paper seems a little bit like an advertisement for all things `git` it is important to remember that git is open-source at the root of its philosophy.

### Key links

<- insert table here ->

The figure above and tables in this publication have several helpful resources. One table lists the success stories (below) and the other table has links to resources for learning git and github (above).  If we remember that there are other options of `version control` then `GIT` `GIThub` are simply case studies of applying a version control workflow for ... in this case bio-informatics.

Table 2: Reproduced table from Perez-Riverol *et al.* (2016). A reduced collection of good practices curated pre-2016. *Bio-informatics repository examples with good practices of using GitHub. The table contains the name of the repository, the type of example*
