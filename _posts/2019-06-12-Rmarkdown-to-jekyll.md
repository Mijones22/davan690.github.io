As with all github projects there always seems to be someone else who has managed to explain and write a blog about what you need, just when you need it... I wish :)

Here is a blog explaining how [Jacob Fiksel](https://jfiksel.github.io/)steps through setting up a blog using RMarkdown.

## My notes

These are my take home points and things I found hard.

1.  Need all the basics to begin with (GIThub, Jekyll, R, RStudio).

2.  FIRST ERROR

```Warning message:
In system2("jekyll", "build"):
'"jekyll"' not found NULL
```
