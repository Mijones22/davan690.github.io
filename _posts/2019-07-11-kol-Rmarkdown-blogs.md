There are so many amazing blogs on the web for doing different variations of `RMarkdown` and its subsequent outcomes.

Here is a collection of the blog posts I am currently interested in:

{: style="text-align: justify"}

- [The RStudio guide for a start](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html/): its good but it just seems that an independent blog or `a stack-overflow` feed is easier to find the answers in. A good start to begin to build RMarkdown documents quickly.

- [Projects as webpages](https://github.blog/2016-08-22-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages/): Directly from the GIThub blog pages.

- [RMarkdown](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/reproducible-projects-with-rstudio-and-r-markdown.html): Introduction to Data Science.
Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R
Rafael A. Irizarry (2019-04-22)

- [Reproducible research course](https://repr-res-r.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/rmarkdown.html): A more interesting RMarkdown online guide

## Difficult aspects of RMarkdown

Although RMarkdown is amazingly powerful for reproducibility however there are several aspects I still struggle with on a daily basis.

### Tables

[Working with tables](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/Recommendations-rmarkdown.html) to produce summary tables can be hard at the best of times but this package is amazing if you can get the tables to render in the output format (word tables are fussy).
