The [Stargazer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/stargazer.pdf) package for R provides a way to create publication quality tables, and a way for researchers
to avoid creating new tables each time they tweak their dataset. This package saves users time, and has
been welcomed by the R community. It outputs tables in multiple formats; from .txt to LaTex code as well
as .html. 

This tutorial will go through the .txt and .html formats and provide the basic understanding needed to create Summary Statistics Tables and Regression Tables.
