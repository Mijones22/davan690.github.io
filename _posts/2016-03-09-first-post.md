    <p>This webpage has resources and information I use for my phd work, as part of the statistics network and other research projects. I hope with time these resources will develop into database for statistical analysis and reproducible research.</p>

I have needed an accessible location to store statistics and ecology resources for a while now and the combination of [Jekyll]("https://jekyllrb.com/") and [GitPages]("https://pages.github.com/") makes it the right time to work on it. I have always written personal notes on methods and techniques I use or recommend such as the [tidyverse]("https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/") approach or the [UBC]("https://stat545.com/") statistics course or the [markdown]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown") script I am writing this post in. Now I work in Markdown almost exclusively it means these can easily be posted as blogs or webposts. Here is the [webpage]("https://www.ssnhub.com/") repository for more computer minded (open-source resources and my research), and a [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/")/[twitter]("https://twitter.com/statistics_the/") feed for new blog posts about statistics and ecology (not all from me). Welcome to the "Pit of Success!" [Great meme from a talk Hadley Wickham gave last year](https://i.imgur.com/7J1bEaJ.mp4/)
