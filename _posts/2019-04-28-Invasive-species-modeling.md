# Thesis

My PhD work involves modelling invasive species dynamics in NZ forests. Please excuse all the '404' errors as I am learning and working as I go. Using version control and git means that I am able to use other coders templates and test things out before committing.

## Running title

Population dynamics of interacting invasive species in New Zealand forests. [Here are some other options]()


## Thesis Overview

The general overview and structure is on [here](https://davan690.github.io/2019-04-28-Invasive-species-modeling) currently but as the documents increase I will convert this into a bookdown document (and then a html book) for my thesis. 

The key research objectives are [here](https://davan690.github.io/2019-05-01-Key-thesis-objectives).
