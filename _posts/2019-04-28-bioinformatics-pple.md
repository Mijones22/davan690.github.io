I often work with colleagues in genetics and have done a small bit of work with [dartR]("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dartR/"). Here is a very limited list of genetics resources for statistics. I am no way an expert with these packages or analyses but have a look here for some detailed resources and lab discussions with [Arthur Gorges](http://georges.biomatix.org/)

## Tutorials

- [Monash Bio-informatics Platform](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/): This is github repository with information for Monash bio-informatics team.

- [Workbook from compgenr package](https://al2na.github.io/compgenr/Genomics/)

- [Comparative Genomics workbook](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/)

- [DartR Genomics workbook](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dartR/vignettes/IntroTutorial_dartR.pdf)

- [R population genetics workbook](https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/PopGenReport/)

- [A reproducible course](https://nlm-repro.github.io/)
