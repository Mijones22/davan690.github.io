As I am finishing up my PhD and working out how to build a career in academia I have ran out of money and resources in the long drawn-out finishing line.

I have also been noticing that I am losing connections (both for work and by not having a business card to direct people to the website when suites them. We have little support in these sorts of areas as graduate students and even less funding . As a graduate student I got the generic card when I asked and since our institute has been incorporated into the universities science department I donâ€™t even dear ask. 

So instead I have built this website but now I still don't have cash for business cards (really just networking tools here) yet even though I have the resource.

This is my solution to business cards with an quirky edge or, as some would say, a student budget.

## Create a basic design

I have put together a very rough logo in the center and added my contact details to a single label template. I found this one below with a very quick google search so I'm sure there are better solutions with some more time however this one:

- doesnt request sign-up before producing content as of June 2019

- this one matches the company stickers I brought = so that the printing will be guaranteed to line up??

I then printed the image which gave me a pdf to download or print. Which leads to a pdf of 36 labels ready to print for 50c in colour printing.

I am not sure if I can just stick these onto politicians wasted junk mail or not?

The labels are expensive but it still works out to be less than .... cents a card and since we are recycling and saving $$.

I figure its a win or at least a stop-gap until I find another funding source.
