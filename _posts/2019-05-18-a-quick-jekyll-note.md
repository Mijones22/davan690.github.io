I am just learning how to run Jekyll on my local computer for testing and have been unsucessful over the past few weeks on my windows PC (uni computer). I have now installed and sucessfully build my github/jekyll site on my MAC and now have to do it again. 

Here are my short reminder steps:

1. Open `bash` terminal

2. Locate the file location of the website

`cd Desktop/`

3. Check the correct place

`pwd`

4. Load site

`bundle jekyll serve`

- if this does not work (with no jekyll found)

Then we need to build jekyll then serve....as so


And that should be it....

## Tutorials and notes

There notes are directly taken from an online [Ucedmy]("") course that I did actually pay for after I couldn't make it work on windows. I would totally recommend this simple course in Jekyll to get on top of everything you can collect in bits over web searches.
