As far as I can tell they are now fully [one-and-the-same]("https://github.blog/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/") only Microsoft promises to keep the same "open-source" culture that github is built on. GIThub is a leading provider for storing both public and private files that also allows for webpage hosting. GIThub uses the [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) version system.

GIThub was officially purchased by Microsoft in 2016 and full [acquisition](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/) in [2018](https://github.blog/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/).
