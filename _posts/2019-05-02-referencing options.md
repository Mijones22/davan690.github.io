Ever since I made a reluctant transition from my trusty [Mendeley account]("https://mendeley.com") to a [Zotero database]("https://www.zotero.org/download/") I have saved the resources and blogs I have used along the way.

I originally moved to Zotero to for three main reasons:

1. Referencing in [Markdown]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown") 

2. Work in software that fit an open-source format 

3. To finally wade through 10 years of saved and un-organised literature.

## Resources

Here are some notes, handy blogs and references for using Zotero to help with my reproducible workflow.
