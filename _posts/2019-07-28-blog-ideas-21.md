|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | It was a long time ago now but this is where we have got to: |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | These drop-in sessions have come about from a research competition that entered in 2017. In this competition, I proposed a university-wide statistical support network in [90 seconds]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EXo0Iue1es"). I didn't win anything substantial although I did not get funded that evening, I did begin to build a series of relationships and collaborations that would lead to a model of this being funding at UC currently. |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | This network is built on the back of the philosophy that collaboration and support are the building blocks of world-leading research and hold many of the solutions we are all hunting for. There is one clear object for this webpage. To provide a location where researchers and others interested in statistics can discuss and be supported to learn statistics. BUT we all have a different way of approaching challanges so to begin the content will reflex my research and tools I am using. |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | I have created a simple [facebook]("https://www.facebook.com/StatisticsNetwork/") feed for new and interesting blog posts about statistics. Information from the website will be posted there is well. All resources are open-source. |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | And on the website I have four simple posts so far:          |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | - General statistics                                         |
|      |      |      | - Ecological statistics                                      |
|      |      |      | - Invasive species research                                  |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | 1.  Comment, discuss or [email]("anthony.davidson@canberra.edu.au") any points that don't make sense. |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | 2.  Or via the website [here]("").                           |
|      |      |      |                                                              |
|      |      |      | 3.  Or even better fork the repository [here]("https://github.com/davan690") and add any comments via git commits. |
