Over the past few years there has been a huge push for better tools for learning and conducting `DataScience` and Statistics in R. [DataCamp](www.datacampcom) along with many other online learning resources [here](/general-statistics/) have been on my radar as part of the resources provided by the Statistics Network but also for my own work.

After starting the Statistics Network at [UC in 2017](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/canberra-students/current-research-students/Welcome-brochure-S1-2019.pdf) I began working with DataCamp to provide resources for my students. THis was great until this came out earlier this year:

"DataCamp quietly published a "community" post today, in which they admit an executive sexually assaulted ("uninvited physical contact") an employee. (link: https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community) datacamp.com/community/blogâ€¦ #Python #rstats #datascience #MeToo" [twitter user]("https://twitter.com/no_reply/status/1113923302915837958")

And then [this](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup)

## Status

There are many other online resources that are both Open source and not mediated with by company misconduct. Therefore I have cancelled my DataCamp subscription and this may also result in my class members also losing access.

I am following many other students and teachers that are doing/done the same.

### Other options

On this website I am hoping to help support any of my students that were working in DataCamp to find open-source resources and can post them on this website.

I will also note that DataCamp has made some additional changes but for me this is "too little, too late."
