Over the past few years there has been a huge push for better tools for learning and conducting `DataScience` and Statistics in R. [DataCamp](www.datacamp.com) along with many other online learning resources [here](/general-statistics/) have been on my radar as part of the resources provided by the Statistics Network but also for my own work.

After starting the Statistics Network at [UC in 2017](https://www.canberra.edu.au/current-students/canberra-students/current-research-students/Welcome-brochure-S1-2019.pdf) I began working with DataCamp to provide resources for my students. THis was great until this came out earlier this year:

"DataCamp quietly published a "community" post today, in which they admit an executive sexually assaulted ("uninvited physical contact") an [employee]("https://twitter.com/no_reply/status/1113923302915837958")

## Status

There are many other online resources that are both open-source and not mediated with by companies misconduct. Therefore I have cancelled my DataCamp subscriptions and this may also result in my class members also losing access. Although I am a little late I am following many other students and teachers that are doing/done the same.

### Other options

I haven't done anything until now as it has taken a while to collate and produce this small website to help support statistics in my lab, at UC and for future from open-source and harassment free resources for myself and others.

On this [website](https://www.ssnhub.com) I am hoping to help support any of my students that were working in DataCamp to find open-source resources and can post them on this website.

I will also note that DataCamp has made some reactive changes but for my research this is a "too little, too late."
