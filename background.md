These drop-in sessions have come about from a competition that I competed in last year (2017). 

## The background

tIn this competition, I proposed a university-wide statistical support network in 90 seconds. I didn't win anything substantial. (There was $12 000 funding up for grabs) but my pitch is [here]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EXo0Iue1es&index=1&list=PLy1v_xE3ZjaA4PFdt_FJNBLljLAiuNTiV/"). Although I did not get funded that evening I did begin to build a series of relationships and collaborations that would lead to a model of this being funding until the current time. This network is built on the back of the philosophy that collaboration and support are the building blocks of world-leading research and hold many of the solutions we are all hunting for.
