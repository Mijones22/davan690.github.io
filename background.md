The website began to develop from a competition that I competed in a few years ago (2017) at the University of Canberra. 

Over the past two years this project has developed into a full collection of reproducible resources for research. The first step was to begin to think about the issue of poor statistical literacy within the university I am currently studying and working at. This competition I entered was called `Pitch for Funds` where researchers compete for up to twelve thousand dollars of funding for there research. In this competition, I proposed a university-wide Statistical Support Network. [Here is my pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EXo0Iue1es&index=1&list=PLy1v_xE3ZjaA4PFdt_FJNBLljLAiuNTiV)

Although I did not get funded that evening I did begin to build a series of relationships and collaborations that would lead to a model of this being funding until the current time at [UC].

The network is a university-wide discussion of statistical design and analysis. This network is built on the back of the philosophy that collaboration and support are the building blocks of world-leading research and hold many of the solutions we are all hunting for.
