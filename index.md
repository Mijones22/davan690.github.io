## Resources

There are many many great resources on the web. I have not tried to reproduce good resources but create a collection I can refer to and supplement as new resources and tools become available.
  
1. [General tools](/general-statistics.md)

2. [Ecological Statistics](/ecological-statistics.md)

3. [Invasive species research](/invasive-species-research.md)

4. [PhD drafts](/thesis-overview.md)

5. [Mapping in R](/creating-maps.md)
