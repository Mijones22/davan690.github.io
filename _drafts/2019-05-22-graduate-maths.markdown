![srw-seaweed](/Users/anthonydavidson/Documents/davidlearning/img/srw-seaweed.jpg)The concept of this book is to create a new way of learning and retaining core mathmatical skill for graduate research. 

TO begin with this website is constructed as a set of developing blog posts using and expanding the key concepts of mathmatics in graduate research by combining a reactive programming approach with simple Australian High School Guidelines/textbooks.

The focus areas are:

1. Triganometry
2. MAtrix algerbra
3. Complex math
4. Graph math
5. Examples

The files

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
