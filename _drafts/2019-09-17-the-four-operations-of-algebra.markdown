Algebra uses pronumerals to help simplify an equation. a pronumeral is defined as any letter or symbol that takes place of a number.

E.G. 

$$3+4mp-2n$$

The letters in this equation are the pronumerals



A term is a number with one or more pronumerals multiplied to it, or it can just be a number with no pronumerals attached.

E.G.

$$3+4mp-2n$$

the terms will be $$3,4,-2$$





coefficents is a number that appears in before a pronumeral



E.G.

$$3+4mp-2n$$

The pronumerals are $$-2,4$$



A constant is a term that has no pronumeral attached to it

E.G.

$$3+4mp-2n$$

The constant is $$3$$
