in algebra you can substitute numbers instead of pronumerals. to do this first you would define what number the pronumeral is then you would replace the pronumeral in the equation with what it is defined as.

E.G.

$$3h-2m+7$$

$$h=1$$

$$m=2$$

now we substitute the letters to the numbers

$$3*1-2*2+7=3-4+7=6$$

you can also define a pronumeral to be a equation. these equations can sometimes have more pronumerals in it

E.G. 

$$3h-2m+7$$

$$h=2+3$$

$$m=3+z$$

now substitute the equations in. to make it easier you can use brackets for the substitution

$$3(2+3)-2(3+z)+7=15-6+2z+7=16+2z$$
