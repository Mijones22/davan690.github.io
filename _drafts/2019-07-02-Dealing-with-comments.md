A test using jekyll

Comments on website moderation ideas.

1. a swear filter that stops swearing and variations such as sh!t or sh1t. 

2. have a report button.

3. have a team of moderators

4. build a bot to scan the comments when they are reported before they get to a person when the bot doesnâ€™t understand.
