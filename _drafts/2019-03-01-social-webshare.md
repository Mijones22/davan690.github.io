## Sharing blog posts on social media

By default, all blog posts will have buttons at the bottom of the post to allow people to share the current page on Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn. You can choose to enable/disable specific social media websites in the _config.yml file. You can also turn off the social media buttons on specific blog posts using social-share: false in the YAML front matter.


## Resource index

There are many many great resources on the web. I have not tried to reproduce good resources but create a collection I can refer to and supplement as new resources and tools become available. These are the key areas so far:
  
1. [General tools](./general-statistics.md)

2. [Ecological Statistics](./ecological-statistics.md)

3. [Invasive species research](/invasive-species-research.md)

4. [PhD drafts](/thesis-overview.md)

5. [Mapping in R](/creating-maps.md)
