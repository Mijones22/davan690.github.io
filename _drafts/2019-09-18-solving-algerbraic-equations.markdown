an equation has a algebraic expression on one side of an equal sign.

E.G.

this is an algebraic expression

$$3x-4$$



this is an algerbraic equation

$$3x-4=20$$



To solve an equation you will need to rearrange the equation to get x by itself

E.G.

$$3x-4=20$$

first we get rid of the constant. we do this by adding a positive four to the left side and to the right side. this is to get rid of the $$-4$$ and what you do to one side you have to do to the other side. 

$$3x-4+4=20+4$$

$$3x=24$$

to get rid of a multiple you have to do the opposite of the times function which is division. like this

$$3x\3=24\3$$

$$x=8$$

to check if the answer is right. substitue the x value into the first equation.



to solve an algebraic equations that involves divides. 

$$3x\7=5$$

This is a divide so we have to multiply by the constant and we do this for both sides. 

$$(3x\7)*7=5*7$$

$$21x\7=35$$

$$3x=35$$

$$3x\3=35\3$$

$$x=35\3$$

you keep trying to remove all numbers from the side of the equation with the unknown pronumeral/s (also called variable/s). simplify any fractions if needed.

to check if it is correct substitute the x value into first equation.

E.G.

$$(3(35\3))\7=5$$

$$(105\3)\7=5$$

$$(105\3)*1\7=5$$

$$105\(3*7)=5$$

$$(105\21)=5$$

$$5=5$$
