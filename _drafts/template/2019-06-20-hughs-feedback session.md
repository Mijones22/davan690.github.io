Some simple notes from Hugh's talk at the University of Canberra. Hugh is a founder of the [thinkwell series]("https://ithinkwell.com.au/"). There are many notes and resources for time management online for PhD students and other researchers including [books]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/bookshop") and [resources]("https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/resources")

- The Pareto Principle

  - The 80/20 rule

  - 80% rule is when you canâ€™t tell if it is getting any better

    | Draft | Final draft | Submit |
    | ----- | ----------- | ------ |
    |       |             |        |
    |       |             |        |
    |       |             |        |

  

Integrating this with a structured time management when some 20% needs to be done for for each paper. Tutorials on how to make this work is easy however how do you deal with these three elements together:

1. Missing deadlines because document is not good enough
2. Handing in incorrect drafts
3. Imposter syndrome



## Feedback

Free advice

Not judgement

### What to ask

- Clearly
- Ask better questions
- Timing
- Reminder after 5-10days or send a reminder
- Deadline

## Comments

Split comments ups to must does and ideas...

If the comments are instructions then do them but ask again if you are not sure what the answer is.




## My notes

- Small bits of writing = blogs = 1 a day?
- Here `blogdown` can work alongside these resources
- Amazing!
