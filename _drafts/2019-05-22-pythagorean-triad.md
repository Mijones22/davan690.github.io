A pyhtageroan traid is a set of three real number shown as $\real$. It fits into the formula $$C^2=A^2+B^2$$

for example 3,4,5 is a pythageroan triad.

To show if a set of numbers is a pythagorean triad you have to take the two smaller numbers and find the sum of them squared.

E.G. 

the traid given is 3,4,5

$$3^2+4^2=9+16  $$

```= 3^2+4^2 = 9+16 = 25```

now we check to see if the largest number squared equals 25 as well

$$5^2=25$$

if they equal the same they can be put into this format



$$5^2=3^2+4^2$$

$$C^2=B^2+A^2$$

the largest number goes in place of C. will the two smallest numbers go into B and A.

$$A=4$$

$$B=3$$

$$C=5$$

## Notation

- $ \real $ is a triad triangle



- $A$ etc. ($B,C...$) are unique numbers.

  

  For example; every time $A$ appears in an equation it will be the same number  for every entry of $A$
