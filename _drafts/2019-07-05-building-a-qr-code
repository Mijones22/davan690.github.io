## My notes

1. Pick a simple option for a online tool to do it.

   - One option [here](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
   - Another one [here](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/): This one is a little simpler
   - I used this [one](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/): I liked this one because of easy custom image insert but I'm sure they are all “much of a muchness”
