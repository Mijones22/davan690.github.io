When I told my supervisor the other day that R is still new I was just a bit off

...I was 4yrs old when it was first launched...

so granted I didn't start here but I do know that RStudio is a lot more user-friendly than when I started. 

```R is a statistical computing language based on an earlier implementation of a programming language called S. S is still available in the commercial form of S-plus, whereas R is in the public domain. S was originally designed at Bell Laboratories in 1976, as an alternative to the FORTRAN language and statistical subroutines available at that time. S offered a more interactive approach to programming, its source version was made public in 1981, it became available in the commercial form in 1984, and it has maintained its popularity particularly among the statistical community.```

## More info

R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (hence the name R) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is now developed by the R Development Core Team. R is considered by its developers to be an implementation of the S programming language.

The R programming language is a hybrid between a third-generation language such as C or FORTRAN and a fourth generation language such as SAS. This provides for much greater flexibility for the analyst but demands much more in terms of programming skills. This will become quickly evident as you move through this module.

R supports a wide variety of statistical and numerical techniques, with comparable benchmark results to Octave and its proprietary counterpart MATLAB. R also provides the analyst with a very wide range of packages, which are user-submitted program libraries, for specific functions or specific areas of study. As a result, R is one of the most comprehensive statistical analysis systems on the market. R has an exceptionally good graphical capacity and can be used to produce publication-quality graphs.

The versatility of R has led to many different styles in the way the program is used. A programmer will use R in a very different way from someone using R to undertake statistical analyses. This module presents only one style. As your skills develop, and you learn more of the capabilities and options of the programming language, you will develop your own style.

## My notes

My point was actually about `Markdown` and `.Rmd`. The not so new `RStudio` and the integration between `R` and `markdown` is less than 5 years old...I could guess about the age that R was when my professor started using the platform in his ...

### The mission

I will build my thesis `bookdown` and will have the ability to built multiple dynamic documents such as an interactive web page with blogs, interactive code (well still being rendered as a classical "thesis" from the same documents) and data collection methods.

To do this I am using tools and workflows that have only become simultaneously accessible since 2018 (`jekyll`,`rmd`, `bookdown` and `citr/zotero`).
