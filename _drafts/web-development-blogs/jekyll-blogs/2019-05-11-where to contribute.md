As I have built this website and integrated it with my PhD work I have been hoping to be able to easily provide drafts and document that my collaborators can access and comment on.

This has not been as easy as I had hoped but there are three ways you can currently contribute:

1. Send me an email with the comments in an attached word document to `the.statistics.network.com` for website based questions or feedback

2. For PhD comments email `anthony.davidson@canberra.edu.au`

3. Collaborate using GIT

Making contribution is simple with git:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub [here](https://github.com/davan690/davan690.github.io)
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Edit the files or add files using your favorite editor
4. Commit changes to your own branch
5. Push your work back up to your fork
6. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

If you're comfortable making contributions any other way, please feel free to do it your way and send us the pull request, we will gladly review the changes.
