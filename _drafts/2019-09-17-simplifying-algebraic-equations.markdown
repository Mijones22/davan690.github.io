To simplify an algebraic equations that only has addition and subtraction, you first need to collect all like terms and put them together, then rewrite the equation so all like terms are next to each other

E.G.

$$3x+4y-2x+7y$$

to put all like terms together you would rearrange the equation to look like this

$$3x-2x+4y+7y$$

the simplified version of this equation is $$x+11y$$

to simplify algebra equations that are multiplied together you would 

first gather the same terms if any, then multiply them together

E.G.

$$3x*4z*2x^2*3z$$

would be rewritten as $$3x*2x^2*4z*3z$$

simplify the like terms $$6x^3*12z$$

then to multiply them together you would first multiply the coeffiences then have the pronumerals be next to the new coeffience.

E.G. 

$$6x^3*12z=7x^3z$$



to simplify an algebraic equation like this $$12x/3xy$$

you would first divide the coeffiences then get rid of like terms

E.G. 

$$12x/3xy=4/y$$

12 divided by 3 is equal to 4 and will stay as the numerator. the two x's cancel each other out so they are removed from the equation. this leaves the 4 as the numerator and y as the denominator.
