When you install R there are a series of basic packages ([base library](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html)) that are automatically installed and loaded when you open RStudio. Additional to this there are many packages that will be necessary for the particular statistics you are carrying out. These packages need to be installed once into the library that is associated with your RStudio installation. These packages also need to be loaded at the start of every RStudio session (this is a little different if you are working on a [project](https://statistics-network.com/2018/03/02/rstudio-projects/)). 

## There are two ways to install new packages in RStudio:

1\. Through the RStudio drop-down menu. ![RStudio_install_packages](https://statistics-network.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/RStudio_install_packages.jpg) 2\. Manually using the following RCode.

### In the R console

<pre>
install.packages()
</pre>

### RStudio dropdown windows
