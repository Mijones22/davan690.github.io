Mana can be tested; 
Even challenged...
But only with dignity and respect!

In my life, I inspire to find happiness through strengthening and developing my Mana. Mana is a Maori word that has no English equivalent however almost every culture as similar statements or words. Mana, in the Maori vocabulary, has several definitions:

**Mana** = “a supernatural force or power that may be ascribed to persons, spirits, or inanimate objects”
Mana (Maori Dictionary) = “to be legal, effectual, binding, authoritative, valid” [Brittanica]()

**Tame titi** = “Your mana comes from knowing who you are, where you come from and your connection to your land.”

But best of all I love the extended definition by Tame titi in this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeK3SkxrZRI).

This video is over 3 mins long but it is the best Ted Talk I have seen in a long time and truely develops the idea of Mana in the Maori culture. My heritage Kiwi. Blended as all cultures are into the stories and personal growth I develop in this section. Always remember….

## The 40%

As my statistics consulting and research develops I hope that I will be able to work within a business structure that will allow me to re-invest 40% of the SSN's profits towards investing in mana and supporting graduate students in my position into the future.
