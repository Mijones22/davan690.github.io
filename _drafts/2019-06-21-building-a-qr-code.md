[QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) are all the rage in many developing and developed countries [just a few blog posts here](). Below are my simple steps to quickly making a single QR code.

## My notes

1. Pick a simple option for a online tool to do it.

   - One option [here](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)
   - Another one [here](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/): This one is a little simpler
   - I used this [one](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/): I liked this one because of easy custom image insert but im sure they are all “much of a muchness”
   - Medium blog https://medium.com/@gliechtenstein/build-a-qrcode-barcode-scanning-app-with-26-lines-of-json-b83453d39197

## Tutorials

There could be a bit to come here....

###### Further points

- There are different types of QR readers (small explaination [here]())
- Here is an online [scanner](https://www.qrstuff.com/scan)

##### An extention

I have used a simple design app made for data scientists and social media advertisers to make simple and quick designs. It is called [desygner](https://desygner.com). This is not the only option and paint will do but this free (basics anyway) gets the image sizes closer than I know how with my mind and a "paint" brush.

##### And Another

This same tech is used for creating and catalogueing databases (even jekyll ones)
