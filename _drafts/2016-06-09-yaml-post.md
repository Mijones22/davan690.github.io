Below I have used code chunks to help collect the different variables in the Front Matter of my website based of `Beautiful` template. And here is the same code with syntax highlighting.

I have created a `gist` for these code snippets because I can never remember them all and as I get older I think this may become work. Check out the fill page [here]()
