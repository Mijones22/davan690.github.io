May is NZ music month and doing a PhD in Australia seems to highlight the lack of a tune nationwide support for our ground roots talent. I like to think it is a numbers game, where Australia has millions and NZ only has a few million so we just don't have the masses.

However, here is my pitch for grass roots acoustic music from the cold and bitter weather of the southern ocean. Her name is 'Lara Rose' and plays in many of my favourite bars in-front of open fires and good pinot noir.
