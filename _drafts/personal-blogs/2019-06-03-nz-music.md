- So I just had a very interesting idea....
- and yes I have too many of them

But this one might be good:

STEPS:

1. Create single promo pages for saim twist and momo as ssnhub/momo and ssnhub/twist
   1. repos
   2. basic html5 template?
   3. /docs folder for attachment to site?
   4. make repo private but /docs folder public?
2. Create qr code and small sticker for momo
3. Create qr code and small sticker for siam twist
4. Page structure (Siam)
