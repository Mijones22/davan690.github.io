“Mana can be tested; 
Even challenged...
But only with dignity and respect!“

In my life, I inspire to find happiness through strengthening and developing Mana. “Mana” is a Maori word that I think has no true English equivalent, however, almost every culture/nationality as similar statements or words. 

Mana, in the Maori vocabulary, has several definitions:

**Mana**

1. “a supernatural force or power that may be ascribed to persons, spirits, or inanimate objects” [Maori Dictionary]()

2. “to be legal, effectual, binding, authoritative, valid” [Brittanica]()

3. “Your mana comes from knowing who you are, where you come from and your connection to your land.” [Tame titi]()

Best of all I like the extended definition by [Tame Titi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Iti) in this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeK3SkxrZRI):

This video is over 3 mins long but it is the best [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks) I have seen in a long time and I think it truly develops the idea of Mana in the Maori culture.

## 40%

As mine and others statistics and small business consulting is conducted through the Statistics Network (SN) we will be able to work within a business structure that will allow the network to re-invest 40% of the SN's profits towards investing in projects based around the Mana of the Statistics network. This will extend to supporting graduate students in the day-today struggle of graduate research into the future.
