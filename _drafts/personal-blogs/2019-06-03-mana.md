Mana can be tested; 
Even challenged...
But only with dignity and respect!

In my life, I inspire to find happiness through strengthening and developing Mana. Mana is a Maori word that has no English equivalent, however, almost every culture/nationality as similar statements or words. Mana, in the Maori vocabulary, has several definitions:

**Mana**

1. “a supernatural force or power that may be ascribed to persons, spirits, or inanimate objects” [Maori Dictionary]()

2. “to be legal, effectual, binding, authoritative, valid” [Brittanica]()

3. “Your mana comes from knowing who you are, where you come from and your connection to your land.” [Tame titi]()

Best of all I like the extended definition by [Tame Titi]() in this [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeK3SkxrZRI):



This video is over 3 mins long but it is the best [Ted Talk]() I have seen in a long time and I think it truely develops the idea of Mana in the Maori culture.

## The 40%

As my statistics consulting through the Statistics Network (SN) I hope that I will be able to work within a business structure that will allow me to re-invest 40% of the SN's profits towards investing in Mana and supporting graduate students in my position into the future. 

*Business structure [coming soon].*
