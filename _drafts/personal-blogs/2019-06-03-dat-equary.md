For a recent assignment for statistical health we were asked to practice a data enquiry. Just wondering what other experiences of this in real life have been like??

## My notes

Here is my example:

Dear Iain,

I am hoping for your assistance with a data query. Following our meeting a few months ago I have been hoping to do a follow-up survey with some additional questions involving persecution of statistics and teaching load.

As you’re aware, I’m currently working for the statistics network, where I’m engaged in statistical and support for all researchers across UC. Can you confirm: this would be in the scope of your knowledge and ethics approval?

If this is possible my data query would require the full dataset after removing the personal information”

Analysis of this data will inform staff professional development sessions, as well as providing a baseline for the evaluation of quality improvement activities.

Kind regards,

Anthony
