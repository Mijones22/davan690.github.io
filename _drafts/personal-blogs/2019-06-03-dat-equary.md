## My notes

Here is my example:

```Dear ...m,```

I am hoping for your assistance with a data query. following oue meeting a few months ago.

As you’re aware, I’m currently working *on Ward B (Rehabilitation), where I’m engaged in a department quality improvement project aimed at reducing falls risks.*

*Can you confirm: Is the most relevant data stored in the Root Cause Analysis and Incident Information Management Systems (IIMS)?*

*My query is as follows: “What factors contributed to falls for patients on Ward B during 2018?”*

*Therefore, I seek de-identified data pertaining to:*

- *Patients admitted to Ward B only*
- *Principle Incident Type (PIT) of “fall”*
- *Incident date between 1 January and 31 December 2018.*
- *Patient age*
- *Patient activity at the time of the fall*
- *Time of fall*
- *Type of injury sustained*

*Other factors, including if the patient has had multiple falls, patient cognitive status and completion of falls risk assessment would be beneficial if available.*

*Analysis of this data will inform staff professional development sessions, as well as providing a baseline for the evaluation of quality improvement activities.*

*Thanks for your assistance*.

*Kind regards,*
