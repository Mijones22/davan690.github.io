**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal sites, blogs, or simple project websites.  [Check out a demo](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes.  You can also look at [my personal website](https://deanattali.com) to see it in use, or see examples of websites other people created using this theme [here](#showcased-users-success-stories).

Also ive special thanks to:
- [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and his project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), from whom I've taken several ideas and code snippets, as well as some documenation tips.
- [Iron Summit Media](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia) and their project [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from which I've used some design ideas and some of the templating code for posts and pagination.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.

Thank you to [all contributors](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/graphs/contributors). Special thanks to  [@OCram85](https://github.com/OCram85) for contributing multiple times as well as helping with discussions.

If you do fork or clone this project to use as a template for your site, I would appreciate if you keep the link in the footer to this project.  I've noticed that several people who forked this repo removed the attribution and I would prefer to get the recognition if you do use this :)

## Known limitations

- If you have a project page and you want a custom 404 page, you must have a custom domain.  See https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/.  This means that if you have a regular User Page you can use the 404 page from this theme, but if it's a website for a specific repository, the 404 page will not be used.
