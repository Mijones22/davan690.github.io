This page is a collection of entry level resources for statistics and research. 

As the education environment changes with the development of computational advances there are now many many online learning tools. 

Until recently, I had been using DataCamp for supporting graduate students, however, since the recent [sexual harassment](https://medium.com/@heathernolis/on-datacamp-aafd82f94e60/) violations I have no desire to advocate for DataCamp. Since then I have removed my class subscription to the DataCamp website. But there is some good news ...

# Courses and Tutorials

Here are a collection of subscription based learning sites like DataCamp that I have come across. When I do courses on any of these platforms I will add the information here under the provider:

##### [Coursa](https://www.coursera.org/)

It seems to be the biggest online provide to me as it ends up on many of my social feeds however I am unsure of the true enrolment numbers between the companies.

##### [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)

##### [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

##### [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

##### [EdX](https://www.edx.org/)

##### [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)

This is a funny situation where it feels almost as though this is actually just an online database with a few LinkedIn courses mixed in but Iâ€™m not sure. Comments below welcome.

#### Online databases

There are even some databases of online courses to make searching and comparing easier!

- [Class central](https://www.classcentral.com/): A database of on-line courses
- [Australian open universities database](https://www.open.edu.au/online-courses/)
- [Even SEEK](https://www.seek.com.au/learning/search/courses/mode-online/): The well-known job advertiser has a search engine for online courses here.

## Open-source

I have found many more open-source tutorials, vignettes and courses tucked away in the depths of `github` and Google. This is a important reason for building the `ssnhub` website as it can be hard to compare and collate all the resources needed to learn open-source content. I hope that with some of the resources here researchers will be able to learn much of the costly content for free well still contributing to the scientific community.

The being of this collection of open-source tools simply aims to cover two simple research aspects;

1.  Application of basic frequentist statistics for any research dataset and;

2. the theory and application of Bayesian Hierarchal Modelling.

To build this, send through the analysis or statistical methods you use and I will see what I can do if it is not below.

## OS providers

#### [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/)

This is an open source community that teaches R and other data tools. They also run workshops and classes at many Australian Universities. IN there words

"Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full life cycle of data-driven research."

#### [Data Science (DS)](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)

These resources are very helpful but take a slightly different approach to ecological studies however the pay is much better as a "data scientist" [DS](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) in the current job market.

The DS community is great and even have there own slack channel. I still haven't found a great resource for this but here are a few general videos to start here; [basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQ61RZKzwE) overview but has a boring intro *or*  [microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNV9EqwXCpw) video here but its pretty dry.

#### More specific resources

As I work on project over my career I will develop the resources along side these outputs to insure that I can reproduce my work for future projects as well as being able to add to the open source community.

I have divided the website over a series of key topics I have worked on during my research career to date.

##### [Ecological statistics](https://www.ssnhub.com/ecological-statistics/)


[Invasive species research](https://www.ssnhub.com/invasive-species-modeling/): My PhD focuses on population modelling of invasive species in New Zealand native forests.

- Hierarchical modelling (*coming*)
- Bayesian modelling (*coming*)

##### [Health](https://bookdown.org/taragonmd/phds/)

I have done many small projects with colleagues at the University of Canberra and Otago University. I am looking forward to continueing to develop these resources in parallell with my ecological population modelling research.

## R-Coding Resources

There are may resources throughout the website but here is a quick list of interesting R applications for learning and developing R programming skills.

- [Analysising patient data](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/aio.html): A basic intro to R using a simulated patient dataset.

- [r-shiny pages](https://github.com/davan690/awesome-rshiny): A repositiory of resources I am working on.

- [A cool GIST](https://gist.github.com/StevenMMortimer): finds the most popular `R` packages currently

- [A pirate guide](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/YaRrr.pdf): Another crazy ecological R programmers guide. I have heard he lectures in a pirate suit...

- [RMArkdown guide](http://252s-epi.vet.unimelb.edu.au/~epi/epi_html/Courses/ID_FAO_EID_risk_mapping/docs/02-Intro_R/Xie_et_al_R_Markdown_Definitive_Guide.pdf)

- [`bookdown` guide]()

- [GIS `bookdown` course](http://geog.uoregon.edu/bartlein/courses/geog490/week05.html); [images here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/add-images-to-rmarkdown-report/)

-[shiny combos](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/2671/Combining-Shiny-R-Markdown.html): Shiny is an amazing extention of R

- [RMD pimping](https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/): Some funky hack's for RMarkdown documents to deal with [knitr and markdown](https://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/Rmarkdown.html).

## My notes

Another quick hack if you want to add this to your RMarkdown document. COpy this page and paste into
this  html-markdown [converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/html-to-markdown). Add the output directly to RStudio file.
